#Forest Cover Type Prediction

This project aims to predict the forest cover type, which refers to the predominant kind of tree cover, using cartographic variables. The dataset contains raw data derived from the US Forest Service (USFS) Region 2 Resource Information System, as well as data obtained from the US Geological Survey and USFS. The independent variables are strictly cartographic and do not include remotely sensed data.

##Dataset Description

The dataset contains information about 30 x 30 meter cells within the study area, located in the Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado. The forest cover type for each cell was determined based on the USFS data. Additionally, binary columns represent qualitative independent variables such as wilderness areas and soil type.

The study area includes four wilderness areas characterized by minimal human-caused disturbances. Consequently, the existing forest cover types in these areas are primarily influenced by ecological processes rather than forest management practices.

##Machine Learning Model

To predict the forest cover type, a machine learning model was developed using Python. Various machine learning algorithms were tested, including fitting extra trees and random forest. The ensemble method achieved an accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score of 91%. The Python notebook provided in this repository demonstrates the process of building and evaluating the ML model.

Feature engineering played a crucial role in improving the model's performance. By creating new features through logical combinations of existing features and then performing feature selection based on their importance, the model's predictive capabilities were enhanced. Feature creation allowed the model to capture additional patterns and relationships in the data, leading to improved accuracy.

##Kaggle Submission

The output of the developed model was submitted to Kaggle, a popular data science competition platform. The submission achieved a position in the top 100, demonstrating the effectiveness of the machine learning model and the feature engineering techniques applied.
